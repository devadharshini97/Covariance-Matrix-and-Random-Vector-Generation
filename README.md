# Covariance-Matrix-and-Random-Vector-Generation

From a random vector U of (X,Y), the covariance matrix is generated and using which the X random vector series is found. The theoretical and computational methods are both done and it can be found in the report. The coding is done in MATLAB and the results are again attached inside the report.
